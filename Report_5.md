# Lab Report 5 
## Debugging Scenario
**What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?**

I am using VsCode on Windows 11

**Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. 
Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.**

As you can see, the terminal just looks pretty wonky, it still even runs even if the code said there was an error on line 10. But after compiling, 

**Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.**
